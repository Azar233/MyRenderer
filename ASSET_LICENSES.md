## Source-tree-only reference models

The following legacy/reference models remain useful for local importer checks,
but are deliberately excluded from CPack binary releases:

- `bunny.obj` and `bunny_hole.dae`: Stanford Bunny derivatives. Stanford permits
  research use and free redistribution with acknowledgement, but restricts
  commercial product use without permission. Source: Stanford Computer Graphics
  Laboratory, Stanford 3D Scanning Repository.
- `dragon2.dae`: Stanford Dragon derivative. The same Stanford repository terms
  apply.
- `cow.dae`, `spot_*.obj` / `spot_*.mtl`, and their `spot_*` / `hmap.jpg`
  textures: legacy sample assets whose exact
  upstream revision and redistribution grant have not yet been established.

No rights beyond the original owners' terms are claimed for these reference
models. Do not include them in a commercial or redistributable build until their
provenance is replaced with a verifiable permissive source.

SR-P1B's original procedural room (`src/pathtracer/AcceptanceScene.cpp`),
`docs/reference-images/sr-p1b-diffuse.{hdr,png}`, and `emissive_test.*` fixtures
were created for MyRenderer and are covered by the project MIT license.
